CHANGELOG
=========


v0.5.5 - February 21, 2026
---------------------------

Improvements:

  - Boss Attack Audio Redesign: Replaced continuous rising-pitch sirens
    with distinct 3-beep patterns per attack type. Each attack now has
    clearly different speed, frequency, and waveform:
      * Charge: 3 fast beeps at 600 Hz (aggressive square+sine)
      * Spikes: 3 medium beeps at 350 Hz (deep rumble + sub-octave)
      * Fireball: 3 very fast beeps at 800 Hz (sharp sine)
      * Heal: 3 slow beeps at 250 Hz (gentle sine + harmonic)


v0.5.4 - February 20, 2026
---------------------------

New Features:

  - Boss Attack Telegraphs: Screen reader announces each boss attack type
    before it happens: "Charge!", "Spikes!", "Fireball!", "Healing!".
    Patches the Dreadnought's telegraph animation methods to give blind
    players advance warning of incoming attacks.

  - Boss Attack Charging Audio: Rising-pitch alarm sound plays when the
    boss telegraphs an attack. Each attack type has a distinct frequency
    range for differentiation:
      * Charge: 400-1000 Hz (aggressive square+sine mix)
      * Spikes: 300-800 Hz (rumbling rising tone)
      * Fireball: 500-1200 Hz (sharp rising tone)
      * Heal: 200-400 Hz (gentle warble with sine harmonics)
    Audio is directionally panned toward the boss position.

  - Boss HP Threshold Announcements: Boss health percentage is
    automatically announced at key thresholds: 75%, 50%, 25%, 15%, 10%,
    and 5%. "Boss!" announced when the boss health bar first appears.
    "Boss defeated!" announced on boss death. "Boss healed" announced
    with cooldown to avoid spam during heal ticks.

  - Boss Attacks Volume: New volume slider in the Mod Settings Menu (F1)
    to adjust boss attack audio independently from other audio cues.

  - Boss Attack Audio Previews: 4 new audio cue previews in the Mod
    Settings Menu — Boss Charge, Boss Spikes, Boss Fireball, Boss Heal.


v0.5.3 - February 20, 2026
---------------------------

New Features:

  - Gear Equipped Status: When browsing gear items in the inventory, each
    item now announces whether it is equipped. "Equipped" is announced
    early — right after the gear name and slot type — so the user
    immediately knows the item's status before hearing stats, costs, etc.
    Example: "Iron Plate, Armor, Equipped, Rare, Tier 3, Stats: ..."

  - Equipped Gear Summary (T key): Press T in the gear inventory to hear
    a summary of all currently equipped gear organized by slot type.
    Example: "Equipped gear: Armor: Iron Plate. Tool: Pickaxe.
    Weapon Mod: Overclock Module"


v0.5.2 - February 17, 2026
---------------------------

Bug Fixes:

  - Fixed footstep sounds continuing to play after the player stops moving.
    The speed smoothing was too slow to decay, causing 1-2 seconds of extra
    footsteps after standing still. Now uses faster decay when the player
    stops for near-instant silence.


v0.5.1 - February 16, 2026
---------------------------

New Features:

  - Footstep Audio: Material-based footstep sounds play during gameplay.
    Stone footsteps during normal gameplay, metal footsteps when near the
    drop pod ramp. Sounds play at a consistent rhythm based on movement,
    and stop when the player is stationary or colliding with walls.
    10 randomized sound variations per material for natural feel.

  - Footsteps Toggle: New on/off toggle in the Mod Settings Menu (F1) to
    enable or disable footstep sounds. Enabled by default.

  - Footsteps Volume: New volume slider in the Mod Settings Menu to adjust
    footstep volume independently from other audio cues.


v0.5.0 - February 16, 2026
---------------------------

New Features:

  - Mod Settings Menu: Press F1 (or Y button on gamepad) outside gameplay to
    open the mod settings menu with configurable options:
      * Volume sliders for 6 audio cue categories (Wall Navigation, Enemy
        Detection, Drop Pod Beacon, Supply Pod Beacon, Hazard Warning,
        Collectibles) — adjustable 0-100% in 5% steps with Left/Right arrows
      * Detection range settings: Enemy Range (10-60m), Hazard Range (10-50m),
        Collectible Range Multiplier (0.5x-2.0x), Wall Range (5-25m)
      * Max Hazard Warnings (1-5 simultaneous alarms)
      * Audio Cue Preview submenu with all 19 audio cue previews
      * Save and Cancel options — settings persist to config file next to mod DLL

  - Master Volume Sync: All mod audio cues now scale with the game's master
    volume setting. If you lower the game's master volume, audio cues lower
    proportionally. Works both when adjusting the slider and on game load.

  - Multi-Channel Hazard Warning: The hazard warning system now tracks multiple
    simultaneous hazards (up to 5, configurable). Each hazard gets its own audio
    channel with independent directional panning and frequency. Closest hazard
    is loudest, secondary channels at 70% volume. Exploder detection range
    increased from 8m to 12m.

Improvements:

  - Wall Navigation Volume: Increased base volume from 0.05 to 0.12 so walls
    are more audible relative to other audio cues.

  - Supply Pod Volume: Increased supply pod beacon volume range from 0.28-0.48
    to 0.35-0.55 for better audibility.

  - Audio Cue Preview: Now accessed as a submenu within the Mod Settings Menu
    instead of a standalone menu (Backspace key no longer used).

  - All detection distances are now configurable via the Mod Settings Menu
    instead of being hardcoded values.


v0.4.1 - February 12, 2026
---------------------------

New Features:

  - Gear Upgrade Costs: In the gear inventory upgrade tab, each gear item
    now announces its upgrade cost with currency names and affordability
    (e.g. "Upgrade cost: 50 Credits, 10 Morkite, Cannot afford").

  - Gear Salvage Prices: In the gear inventory sell tab, each gear item
    now announces its salvage value with currency names
    (e.g. "Sell value: 25 Credits, 5 Morkite").

  - Gear Inventory Wallet: Press G in the gear inventory to hear your
    currency balances, just like in the stat upgrades and shop menus.

  - Gear Inventory Tabs: Tab changes in the gear inventory menu are now
    announced via screen reader (e.g. "Equip", "Upgrade", "Salvage").

Bug Fixes:

  - Fixed settings selectors (display, screen mode, resolution, language,
    anti-aliasing) not announcing their new values when changed with
    left/right arrows. Replaced per-selector patches with generic
    StepSelectorBase.IncreaseIndex/DecreaseIndex patches that work
    reliably in IL2CPP.

  - Fixed VSync and Target Framerate toggles not announcing their On/Off
    state when pressed. These plain Unity Toggles can't be patched
    directly, so the SettingsFocusTracker now detects toggle value changes
    by comparing isOn state each frame.

  - Fixed "Equipped" being announced at game startup when the gear
    inventory form briefly initializes its default tab.


v0.4.0 - February 12, 2026
---------------------------

New Features:

  - Enemy Proximity Announcements: Screen reader now announces dangerous enemies
    with priority-based alerts:
      * "Explosive very close!" / "Boss very close!" / "Elite very close!" at < 8m
      * "Explosive nearby" / "Boss nearby" / "Elite nearby" at < 20m
      * "Enemy nearby" / "X enemies nearby" when enemies first enter range

  - Collectible Proximity Announcements: Screen reader announces items with
    direction as you approach them, using distance-based zone transitions:
      * "Red Sugar nearby up-right" → "Red Sugar closer left" → "Red Sugar very close down"
      * 8 directions adapted for top-down perspective (up/down/left/right + diagonals)
      * Announces on zone transitions (getting closer), resets when item is picked up

Improvements:

  - Collectible Detection Range: Significantly increased detection distances for
    all collectible categories to help find items from further away:
      * Red Sugar: 15m → 30m
      * Gear Drop: 18m → 40m
      * Buff Pickup: 12m → 25m
      * Currency: 13m → 28m
      * Mineral Vein: 13m → 28m
      * Loot Crate: 18m → 40m

  - Enemy Detection Range: Reduced from 50m to 35m for a more focused and less
    cluttered audio experience.

  - Drop Pod Pathfinding: Major improvements to close-range navigation:
      * NavMesh pathfinding now stays active until 3m (was disabled at 8m)
      * Direct targeting only used when line of sight is clear (raycast check)
      * Prevents getting stuck near the pod with walls blocking the path
      * Ramp tone frequency no longer goes flat when playerPoint is far from ramp
      * Path recalculation interval reduced from 0.5s to 0.3s
      * Waypoint selection minimum distance reduced from 2m to 1.5m


v0.3.2 - February 12, 2026
---------------------------

New Features:

  - Gamepad Support: All mod-specific inputs now support both keyboard and gamepad.
      * D-Pad Up/Down: navigate custom menus (end screen, milestones, audio cues)
      * A button: confirm/activate
      * B button: close/back
      * Y button: toggle audio cue preview menu
      * LB: read HP
      * RB: read wallet balance
      * L3 (left stick press): compass direction to drop pod

  - Gear Upgrade Feedback: Screen reader now announces "Upgraded [gear name]"
    when upgrading gear in the gear inventory.

  - Gear Salvage Feedback: Screen reader now announces "Salvaged [gear name]"
    when salvaging/selling gear.

Bug Fixes:

  - Fixed antialiasing setting not announcing its value when changed in the
    video settings menu. Was passing null instead of the display text field.

  - Fixed gear equip/unequip feedback ("Equipped X" / "Unequipped X") being
    immediately overwritten by the next button's announcement when the UI
    shifts focus after the action. Action feedback now queues the following
    button announcement instead of letting it interrupt.


v0.3.1 - February 11, 2026
---------------------------

New Features:

  - Locked Class Requirements: Locked classes now announce the player rank
    required to unlock them (e.g. "Engineer, Locked. Unlocks at player rank 3").

  - HP in Shop: Press H in the shop screen to hear your current HP, helping
    decide whether to spend on healing.

Improvements:

  - Drop Pod Guidance Overhaul:
      * Ramp guidance zone expanded from 2.5m to 5m for earlier interior guidance.
      * All audio (beacon beeps + continuous tone) now targets playerPoint (the
        exact departure trigger) instead of the ramp when in the guidance zone.
      * Ramp tone uses directional pitch modulation — higher and louder when
        facing the entry point, lower when facing away.
      * Added "very close" zone (< 1.5m from playerPoint) with peak audio
        intensity and "Almost inside, keep going" announcement.
      * F key compass reports direction and distance to playerPoint when in the
        guidance zone (e.g. "Pod entrance: up-right, 2 meters").
      * Announcements: "Drop pod very close" (8m) → "Near the pod, follow the
        tone inside" (5m) → "Almost inside, keep going" (1.5m) → "Inside the pod".

  - Supply Pod Volume: Increased supply pod beacon volume (0.20-0.38 → 0.28-0.48)
    so it stands out better among other audio cues.

  - Red Sugar Volume: Decreased red sugar audio volume (0.30-0.50 → 0.22-0.40)
    to reduce clutter.


v0.3.0 - February 11, 2026
---------------------------

New Features:

  - NavMesh Pathfinding: Drop pod beacon now uses Unity's NavMesh to calculate
    paths around walls and obstacles instead of pointing in a straight line.
    Beacon guides toward the next path waypoint. Falls back to direct targeting
    if path fails or within 8m of pod. Path recalculated every 0.5s.

  - Ramp Interior Guidance: When near the drop pod ramp (< 2.5m), a continuous
    tone pans toward the pod interior (playerPoint — the exact spot that triggers
    departure). Screen reader announces "On the ramp, follow the tone inside".

  - Directional Pitch Modulation: All spatial audio cues now sound higher-pitched
    when the target is ahead (W/up direction) and lower when behind (S/down).
    This helps distinguish forward from behind in the top-down perspective.
    Drop pod uses a pronounced 0.4x-1.0x range; all other cues use 0.6x-1.0x.

  - Supply Zone Guidance: Supply pod zones now announce enter/exit, activation
    state ("Clearing zone, X rocks to mine"), progress as rocks are mined,
    timer milestones every 10 seconds, and completion. Beacon stays active when
    activating and player is outside to guide them back.

  - Pickup Announcements: Screen reader now announces during gameplay:
      * Heals: "Healed X HP" (direct heals only, not regen or stat setup)
      * Currency: "X [currency name]" with cooldown to avoid spam
      * Gear: "Picked up [gear name]"
      * Loot crates: "[rarity] loot crate"

  - HP Reader: Press H during active gameplay to hear current and max HP
    (e.g. "HP: 85 / 120").

  - Shop Pin Toggles: Pin/lock buttons in the shop now announce
    "Pin [item name], Pinned/Unpinned" instead of generic toggle text.

  - Shop Price Buttons: Heal and Reroll buttons now read their label, price
    with currency name, and affordability (e.g. "Heal 50%. Price: 30 Gold").

Improvements:

  - Shop Wallet: Gold balance is now always shown when pressing G, even when
    zero (it's the primary shop currency). Previously only shown if > 0.

  - Shop Currency Names: Shop item prices now show the currency name
    (e.g. "50 Gold") instead of just the number.

  - Drop Pod Audio Cue Preview: Added 3 new previews to the Audio Cue Preview
    menu — Drop Pod Critical (close range double-beep) and Ramp Tone (continuous
    guidance tone near the ramp).

Bug Fixes:

  - Fixed "Max HP increased by 10" announcement on game start. Heal
    announcements now only fire for direct heals (EHealType.HEAL), not
    REGEN or MAX_HP which fire during stat initialization.

  - Fixed shop toggle labels showing "UISliderToggle, Off" or
    "Shop Button Group, Off" — now correctly identifies pin toggles
    and reads the associated item name.


v0.2.0 - February 11, 2026
---------------------------

New Features:

  - Collectible Audio Cues: 3D positional audio for 7 categories of collectible
    items during gameplay. Each category has a distinct sound and beeps faster as
    you get closer:
      * Red Sugar (health): Water-drop "bloop" with descending frequency sweep
      * Gear Drops (weapons/equipment): Rich two-tone chord
      * Buff Pickups (magnet, speed, berserk, etc.): Electric FM synthesis buzz
      * Currency (gold/minerals): Crystalline chime
      * Mineral Veins (mineable blocks): Metallic clink like a pickaxe on rock
      * Loot Crates (from elites/Huuli Hoarders): Shimmering sparkle
      * XP Orbs: Soft continuous triangle wave with tremolo (pitch = distance)

  - Objective Announcements: Mission objectives are now announced via screen reader.
    Objective text when it appears, progress updates (throttled to avoid spam), and
    completion announced with interrupt priority.

  - Unlock Screen Accessibility: When unlocking new weapons, artifacts, or masteries,
    the unlock name, stats, and description are now announced via screen reader.

  - Audio Cue Preview: 7 new collectible audio previews added to the Audio Cue
    Preview menu (Backspace).

Improvements:

  - Drop Pod Beacon: Completely redesigned sound. Now a metallic sonar ping with
    reverberant ring, clearly distinct from enemy beeps.

  - Supply Pod Beacon: Completely redesigned sound. Now a warbling trill with
    mechanical buzz, clearly distinct from both the drop pod and enemies.

  - XP Nearby Sound: Changed from pure sine wave to triangle wave with 6 Hz
    tremolo, so it no longer sounds like wall detection tones.

  - Sound Distinctiveness: All collectible, beacon, and enemy sounds now use
    fundamentally different synthesis techniques (FM synthesis, frequency sweeps,
    inharmonic overtones, detuned oscillators) to be easily distinguishable.

Bug Fixes:

  - Fixed unlock screen not reading unlock details (was patching Show() which fires
    before text is populated; now patches ShowMilestone() and ShowMastery() which
    fire after text is set).


v0.1.0 - February 10, 2026
---------------------------

Initial release with full menu accessibility, gameplay audio cues (walls, enemies,
beacons, hazards), and screen reader support for all game screens.
