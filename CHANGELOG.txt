CHANGELOG
=========


v0.3.0 - February 11, 2026
---------------------------

New Features:

  - NavMesh Pathfinding: Drop pod beacon now uses Unity's NavMesh to calculate
    paths around walls and obstacles instead of pointing in a straight line.
    Beacon guides toward the next path waypoint. Falls back to direct targeting
    if path fails or within 8m of pod. Path recalculated every 0.5s.

  - Ramp Interior Guidance: When near the drop pod ramp (< 2.5m), a continuous
    tone pans toward the pod interior (playerPoint — the exact spot that triggers
    departure). Screen reader announces "On the ramp, follow the tone inside".

  - Directional Pitch Modulation: All spatial audio cues now sound higher-pitched
    when the target is ahead (W/up direction) and lower when behind (S/down).
    This helps distinguish forward from behind in the top-down perspective.
    Drop pod uses a pronounced 0.4x-1.0x range; all other cues use 0.6x-1.0x.

  - Supply Zone Guidance: Supply pod zones now announce enter/exit, activation
    state ("Clearing zone, X rocks to mine"), progress as rocks are mined,
    timer milestones every 10 seconds, and completion. Beacon stays active when
    activating and player is outside to guide them back.

  - Pickup Announcements: Screen reader now announces during gameplay:
      * Heals: "Healed X HP" (direct heals only, not regen or stat setup)
      * Currency: "X [currency name]" with cooldown to avoid spam
      * Gear: "Picked up [gear name]"
      * Loot crates: "[rarity] loot crate"

  - HP Reader: Press H during active gameplay to hear current and max HP
    (e.g. "HP: 85 / 120").

  - Shop Pin Toggles: Pin/lock buttons in the shop now announce
    "Pin [item name], Pinned/Unpinned" instead of generic toggle text.

  - Shop Price Buttons: Heal and Reroll buttons now read their label, price
    with currency name, and affordability (e.g. "Heal 50%. Price: 30 Gold").

Improvements:

  - Shop Wallet: Gold balance is now always shown when pressing G, even when
    zero (it's the primary shop currency). Previously only shown if > 0.

  - Shop Currency Names: Shop item prices now show the currency name
    (e.g. "50 Gold") instead of just the number.

  - Drop Pod Audio Cue Preview: Added 3 new previews to the Audio Cue Preview
    menu — Drop Pod Critical (close range double-beep) and Ramp Tone (continuous
    guidance tone near the ramp).

Bug Fixes:

  - Fixed "Max HP increased by 10" announcement on game start. Heal
    announcements now only fire for direct heals (EHealType.HEAL), not
    REGEN or MAX_HP which fire during stat initialization.

  - Fixed shop toggle labels showing "UISliderToggle, Off" or
    "Shop Button Group, Off" — now correctly identifies pin toggles
    and reads the associated item name.


v0.2.0 - February 11, 2026
---------------------------

New Features:

  - Collectible Audio Cues: 3D positional audio for 7 categories of collectible
    items during gameplay. Each category has a distinct sound and beeps faster as
    you get closer:
      * Red Sugar (health): Water-drop "bloop" with descending frequency sweep
      * Gear Drops (weapons/equipment): Rich two-tone chord
      * Buff Pickups (magnet, speed, berserk, etc.): Electric FM synthesis buzz
      * Currency (gold/minerals): Crystalline chime
      * Mineral Veins (mineable blocks): Metallic clink like a pickaxe on rock
      * Loot Crates (from elites/Huuli Hoarders): Shimmering sparkle
      * XP Orbs: Soft continuous triangle wave with tremolo (pitch = distance)

  - Objective Announcements: Mission objectives are now announced via screen reader.
    Objective text when it appears, progress updates (throttled to avoid spam), and
    completion announced with interrupt priority.

  - Unlock Screen Accessibility: When unlocking new weapons, artifacts, or masteries,
    the unlock name, stats, and description are now announced via screen reader.

  - Audio Cue Preview: 7 new collectible audio previews added to the Audio Cue
    Preview menu (Backspace).

Improvements:

  - Drop Pod Beacon: Completely redesigned sound. Now a metallic sonar ping with
    reverberant ring, clearly distinct from enemy beeps.

  - Supply Pod Beacon: Completely redesigned sound. Now a warbling trill with
    mechanical buzz, clearly distinct from both the drop pod and enemies.

  - XP Nearby Sound: Changed from pure sine wave to triangle wave with 6 Hz
    tremolo, so it no longer sounds like wall detection tones.

  - Sound Distinctiveness: All collectible, beacon, and enemy sounds now use
    fundamentally different synthesis techniques (FM synthesis, frequency sweeps,
    inharmonic overtones, detuned oscillators) to be easily distinguishable.

Bug Fixes:

  - Fixed unlock screen not reading unlock details (was patching Show() which fires
    before text is populated; now patches ShowMilestone() and ShowMastery() which
    fire after text is set).


v0.1.0 - February 10, 2026
---------------------------

Initial release with full menu accessibility, gameplay audio cues (walls, enemies,
beacons, hazards), and screen reader support for all game screens.
