CHANGELOG
=========


v0.2.0 - February 11, 2026
---------------------------

New Features:

  - Collectible Audio Cues: 3D positional audio for 7 categories of collectible
    items during gameplay. Each category has a distinct sound and beeps faster as
    you get closer:
      * Red Sugar (health): Water-drop "bloop" with descending frequency sweep
      * Gear Drops (weapons/equipment): Rich two-tone chord
      * Buff Pickups (magnet, speed, berserk, etc.): Electric FM synthesis buzz
      * Currency (gold/minerals): Crystalline chime
      * Mineral Veins (mineable blocks): Metallic clink like a pickaxe on rock
      * Loot Crates (from elites/Huuli Hoarders): Shimmering sparkle
      * XP Orbs: Soft continuous triangle wave with tremolo (pitch = distance)

  - Objective Announcements: Mission objectives are now announced via screen reader.
    Objective text when it appears, progress updates (throttled to avoid spam), and
    completion announced with interrupt priority.

  - Unlock Screen Accessibility: When unlocking new weapons, artifacts, or masteries,
    the unlock name, stats, and description are now announced via screen reader.

  - Audio Cue Preview: 7 new collectible audio previews added to the Audio Cue
    Preview menu (Backspace).

Improvements:

  - Drop Pod Beacon: Completely redesigned sound. Now a metallic sonar ping with
    reverberant ring, clearly distinct from enemy beeps.

  - Supply Pod Beacon: Completely redesigned sound. Now a warbling trill with
    mechanical buzz, clearly distinct from both the drop pod and enemies.

  - XP Nearby Sound: Changed from pure sine wave to triangle wave with 6 Hz
    tremolo, so it no longer sounds like wall detection tones.

  - Sound Distinctiveness: All collectible, beacon, and enemy sounds now use
    fundamentally different synthesis techniques (FM synthesis, frequency sweeps,
    inharmonic overtones, detuned oscillators) to be easily distinguishable.

Bug Fixes:

  - Fixed unlock screen not reading unlock details (was patching Show() which fires
    before text is populated; now patches ShowMilestone() and ShowMastery() which
    fire after text is set).


v0.1.0 - February 10, 2026
---------------------------

Initial release with full menu accessibility, gameplay audio cues (walls, enemies,
beacons, hazards), and screen reader support for all game screens.
